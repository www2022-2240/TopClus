# Submission \# 2240 Code and Datasets

## Datasets

We provide the two datasets used in the paper under `datasets/nyt` and `datasets/yelp`. You need to extract the text files from the `.tar.gz` file.

## Requirements

Before running the code, you need to install the required packages via
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code

We provide two shell scripts `nyt.sh` and `yelp.sh` for reproducing the experiments on the two datasets.
